#Android Terminal Emulator

Android Terminal Emulator is a terminal emulator for communicating with the built-in Android shell.
Emulates a reasonably large subset of Digital Equipment Corporation VT-100 terminal codes, so
that programs like "vi", "Emacs" and "NetHack" will display properly.

This code is based on the "Term" application which is included in the Android source code release.
It's provided as a separate project for the convenience of developers who do not want to deal with
installing and building the whole Android source tree.
